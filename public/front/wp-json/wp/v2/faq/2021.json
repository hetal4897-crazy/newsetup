The primary reason why women are more at risk for UTIs is female anatomy, specifically the urethra &#8211; the tube that transports urine from the bladder out of the body. While the urethra allows urine to exit, it also allows bacteria to enter the urinary tract. Women&#8217;s urethras are significantly shorter than men&#8217;s. Female urethra is usually 1-2 inches long while male urethra is 6 inches long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to bacteria, this is a risk factor because the<strong> <\/strong>most common bacteria in females that cause UTIs is called E Coli which is found in the faecal content in the anal region. These bacterias get seeded (or planted) at the urethra meatus (the entrance of the urethra where urine exits), thus they have a shorter distance to travel to infect the bladder in females than in males.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How common are UTIs?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One out of five women will experience urinary tract infections at some point in their lives. Although<strong> <\/strong>UTIs are common in women, they can also affect men, older adults, and children. Urinary tract infections affect between 1% to 2% of children. Urinary tract infections account for 8 million to 10 million doctor visits each year.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the symptoms of UTIs?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common symptoms of UTIs include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A strong, constant urge to urinate<\/li><li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/uti\/how-to-reduce-burning-sensation-while-peeing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">burning sensation while peeing<\/a><\/li><li>Urinating frequently but in little amounts<\/li><li>Urine with a cloudy appearance<\/li><li>Pee that is red, bright pink, or cola-colored which indicates that there is blood in the urine<\/li><li>Urine with a strong odour&nbsp;<\/li><li>Pelvic pain, particularly around the pubic bone area and in the centre of the pelvis <sup>3<\/sup><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to prevent UTIs?<\/strong> <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent UTIs in females, the following steps are advised:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Pee after sex &#8211; <\/strong>Peeing after sex may help remove bacteria from the urethra, preventing a urinary tract infection (UTI).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Wipe from front to back &#8211;<\/strong> If you aren\u2019t wiping well after passing stools, it&#8217;s easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract and infect you.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Always sanitize sex toys like butt plugs, etc. &#8211; <\/strong>Using sex toys that aren&#8217;t hygienic can introduce bacteria into the vaginal area, which can lead to a urinary tract infection.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Change condoms when switching from anal to vaginal sex &#8211;<\/strong> A penis with or without a condom can contain bacteria that can be transferred from the anal region to the vaginal region when switching positions in between sex. Therefore, it is very important to change condoms. This will also protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mycoplasma which can also cause urethritis.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Drink water and lots of fluids, and stay hydrated &#8211; <\/strong>Increasing your daily fluid intake, particularly water, can aid in the removal of bacteria from your urinary tract. It is suggested that you drink six to eight glasses of water every day.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>When to see your doctor?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have signs of a urinary tract infection, contact your doctor. Call your doctor if you&#8217;ve been diagnosed with a UTI and your symptoms are becoming worse. You might need a different approach.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep an eye out for the following symptoms &#8211; fever, back pain, and vomiting. Call your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms or if your other symptoms persist despite treatment. A urinary tract infection (UTI) can spread throughout your body and into other organs. Treatment, on the other hand, is quite effective and can swiftly ease your problems.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1079\" height=\"716\" class=\"wp-image-2022\" style=\"width: 470px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Why-is-urinary-tract-infection-common-in-females-1.png\" alt=\"urinary tract infection is common in female- ask pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Why-is-urinary-tract-infection-common-in-females-1.png 1079w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Why-is-urinary-tract-infection-common-in-females-1-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Why-is-urinary-tract-infection-common-in-females-1-1024x680.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Why-is-urinary-tract-infection-common-in-females-1-768x510.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[12],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/2021"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2021"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=2021"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

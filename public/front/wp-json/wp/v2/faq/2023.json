There are a number of factors that might impact when you start to feel better and when your body clears out the germs completely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first factor to consider when determining how long a UTI will stay is whether it is deemed simple or complicated. Uncomplicated UTIs are significantly more common than complicated UTIs, and last for about 3-5 days and may even take up to seven days to cure for some people. They usually occur in the lower urinary system (usually the bladder) and do not have any other characteristics that make treatment more challenging. Complicated UTIs on the other hand, take up to 14 days or more to be treated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body&#8217;s<strong> <\/strong>immune system can sometimes clear out invading bacteria without the use of drugs. In case uncomplicated UTI is left untreated, it can make it easier for bacteria to multiply and symptoms to worsen, turning it into a complicated UTI. Antibiotics are considered the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; for UTI treatments, and it&#8217;s always a good idea to visit a doctor if you&#8217;re experiencing symptoms of a UTI. Doctors frequently prescribe antibiotics to people who appear to have UTI symptoms in the hopes of killing the bacteria. To figure out what&#8217;s going on, they&#8217;ll take a urine sample (midstream urine). Once the test results are in (typically within a day or two), your doctor may switch you to an antibiotic that is more effective at killing the germs that caused your infection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antibiotics will speed up the healing process. Symptoms should improve within 36 hours in the majority of cases. That is to say, you will feel better once the correct treatment for the bacteria causing your UTI has been prescribed, but you will not be &#8220;cured.&#8221; Although you might not experience a frequent urge to urinate (or other UTI symptoms), the bacteria responsible for it could still be present.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to take antibiotics for three to five days altogether until the UTI is totally cleared up. While you may want to stop taking your medicines as soon as you feel better, it is important to complete the course so you leave no space for the infection to trigger again soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How long does complicated UTI last?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Complex UTIs might linger for several weeks. A lot of factors can influence how long a severe urinary tract infection lasts, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; whether you&#8217;re a pregnant woman or postmenopausal&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; if the infection is caused by germs that are drug-resistant<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; if you have a catheter, stent, nephrostomy tubes, or other medical devices&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; if you have kidney stones or something abnormal in your urinary tract<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; If you have a chronic illness, such as diabetes or a weakened immune system <sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How are UTI diagnosed?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To identify a urinary tract infection, your doctor will perform the following tests:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Urine routine test (Urinalysis)&nbsp;&#8211;<\/strong> This test checks for red blood cells, white blood cells, and bacteria in the urine. The presence of white and red blood cells in your urine can indicate the presence of an infection.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Urine culture test &#8211; <\/strong>A urine culture is used to determine the type of bacteria present in your urine and antibiotics the bacteria is resistant to. This is an important test since it aids in determining the best course of action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your infection does not respond to therapy or if you keep getting infections, your doctor may do the following tests to check for disease or injury in your urinary tract:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ultrasound:<\/strong> Sound waves provide an image of the interior organs in this test. This test is performed on top of your skin, is painless, and requires no special preparation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cystoscopy: <\/strong>This test employs a specific device (cystoscope) with a lens and a light source to see inside the bladder through the urethra.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CT scan:<\/strong> A CT scan is another form of imaging test that takes cross-sections of the body (like slices). This technique is far more accurate than normal X-rays.<sup>2<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How is complicated UTI treated?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To get rid of bacteria in the urinary tract more effectively, complicated UTIs may require broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, even though treatment will continue for 14 days, you will most likely feel better soon. The burning with urination will improve as your body begins to tackle infection. You should also drink plenty of water to aid in the healing process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The excruciating pain of a UTI usually goes away within a day or two of commencing treatment, so relax: Healing is on its way!&nbsp;Just remember to finish the antibiotic course to avoid a subsequent illness that&#8217;s far more difficult to treat than the first.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"718\" class=\"wp-image-2024\" style=\"width: 450px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/How-long-does-a-urinary-tract-infection-last.png\" alt=\"How long does a urinary tract infection last- Pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/How-long-does-a-urinary-tract-infection-last.png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/How-long-does-a-urinary-tract-infection-last-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/How-long-does-a-urinary-tract-infection-last-1024x681.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/How-long-does-a-urinary-tract-infection-last-768x511.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[12],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/2023"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2023"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=2023"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

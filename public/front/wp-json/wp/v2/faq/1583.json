But if you\u2019re searching for \u2018how does a woman get a urinary tract infection\u2019 then keep reading as we explain this to you in detail.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within our body itself, there are bacteria in the vaginal, anal, and genital areas. Bacteria in these areas can enter the urethra (where we pee from), travel to the bladder, and lead to urinary infections. Through the urethra, the bacteria finally enter the bladder and multiply there to cause an infection. Based on where the infection is in the urinary tract, doctors can categorise you as having urethritis (infection of the urethra) or cystitis (infection of the bladder). Due to their shorter urethra, women usually get a urinary tract infection more often than men.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Which bacteria can cause this infection?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bacteria called <em>Escherichia coli <\/em>is one of the most common causes of a UTI. This bacteria is commonly found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and in faecal content. E. Coli can enter a woman\u2019s urinary tract through a whole variety of ways and sexual intercourse is just one such way! &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Behaviours which can cause a UTI in women: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Not maintaining proper hygiene<\/strong>:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can lead to urinary tract infections where bacteria from the anal region can enter the urinary tract. For example, even if you aren\u2019t wiping well after passing stools, it&#8217;s easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract and infect you!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Bacteria transfer through sexual intercourse<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A penis can contain bacteria especially after vaginal or anal intercourse. Similarly, through sex and fingering or even through sex toys, bacteria from the vaginal and anal regions can enter your urinary tract. Sexually transmitted infections like herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mycoplasma can also cause urethritis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Not drinking enough water<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking plenty of water and fluids can ensure that you are peeing frequently and that bacteria are being flushed out of the urinary tract before they have a chance to infect you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Prevention of Urinary Tract Infections<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Drink plenty of liquids to help dilute your urine and ensure that you urinate frequently. This will enable your body to remove the bacteria if any from your urinary tract.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Wiping from front to back to prevent the bacteria to spread to the vagina and urethra.<\/li><li>Emptying your bladder after sex and drinking a glass of water to flush out the bacteria.<\/li><li>Avoiding the use of irritating feminine products.<\/li><li>Changing your birth control methods in case you are using diaphragms, or unlubricated or spermicide-treated condoms.<sup>1<\/sup><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know how to treat urinary tract infection?

Getting tested is the only way to find out for sure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, those with symptoms will often show mild and common ones. There are a lot of common<strong> <\/strong>symptoms of STD in females<strong> <\/strong>that we\u2019ll be discussing in this article which will help you identify and treat the infection before it gets worse. Before getting into the details, let\u2019s first understand the meaning of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is an STD<\/strong>?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A sexually transmitted disease (STD), also known as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), is an infection that is transmitted from one person to another through sexual contact. Vaginal, oral, or anal sex are the most common forms of sexual activities that can spread the infection. They can, however, spread through other forms of intimate physical contact with the infected person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Infections and diseases are as much a part of sex as the pleasure. They affect both males and females and you probably won\u2019t even realise that you\u2019ve had an STD or an STI if you don\u2019t get tested for the same. It is important to know what is good and what is not about your sexual health. Recognizing the signs is a good start, but chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, and other STDs aren&#8217;t always obvious. To protect yourself and your sex partners\/partner you&#8217;ll need to be tested. But you need not worry in case you have one since all of the common STDs can be treated, and the majority of them can be cured as well.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Symptoms of STD in females:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be aware of the signs and symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) so that you can seek medical help if necessary. The following are some of the most common symptoms and signs of STD in females.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Abnormal vaginal discharge:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout a woman&#8217;s cycle, or even in the absence of a period, the appearance and consistency of vaginal discharge changes. A yeast infection can be identified by a thick, white discharge. A yellow or <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/sexually-transmitted-infections\/can-green-discharge-indicate-a-sexually-transmitted-disease\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">green vaginal discharge<\/a> could be an indication of gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Itching in the genital area:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Itching is a general symptom that may or may not be associated with an STI. Vaginal itching can be caused by a variety of sex-related factors, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>an allergic reaction to a latex condom&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>a yeast infection<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>scabies or pubic lice<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>genital warts&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>the initial phases of most bacterial and viral STIs&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Pain during intercourse:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Abdominal or pelvic pain might be a symptom of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is commonly neglected. The most common causes of PID are chlamydia or gonorrhea in its advanced stages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Abnormal bleeding &#8211;<\/strong> Another symptom of PID or other reproductive problems caused by an STI is abnormal bleeding.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rashes or sores &#8211; <\/strong>Sores or tiny pimples around the mouth or vagina can be a sign of herpes, HPV, or syphilis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Urination patterns change &#8211;<\/strong> Pain or a burning sensation while urinating is a common symptom of an STI. Of course, this alone can be confusing because these are also symptoms of a urinary tract infection.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Measures to avoid STDs:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Communicate:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Being able to communicate about your sexual health problems to your doctor as well as your partner is very important. It will help you find a solution and cure it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Use protection:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A condom or other barrier method can help protect both you and your partner, whether it&#8217;s for vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse. Female condoms and dental dams may offer some protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please remember that spermicides, birth control pills, and other kinds of contraception may prevent pregnancy, but they do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Using protection is very important to protect yourself from STIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Get tested regularly:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re sexually active, you should talk to your doctor about STI testing. A Pap smear should be done every 3 to 5 years for those with a vagina. It&#8217;s also crucial to inquire whether you should be tested for any other STIs and whether the HPV vaccine is recommended.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also check out our gynaecologist-verified chatbot in order to understand more about the signs and symptoms of STIs.

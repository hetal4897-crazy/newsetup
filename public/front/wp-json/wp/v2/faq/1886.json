But first let\u2019s understand why do you experience menstrual pain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Prostaglandins and their role in menstrual cramps<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your uterus contracts and relaxes during your period to help shed its lining. Certain hormone-like substances called prostaglandins help cause these contractions. Higher levels of these substances called prostaglandins is associated with higher levels of menstrual cramps. In fact, prostaglandins also help with labour contractions! This is why you&#8217;re likely to experience pain in your abdomen, lower back, and thighs in varying degrees when you get your periods! There are several ways, both natural as well as through medications, that you can reduce your cramps. However, if you are in unbearable pain, always make it a point to talk to your doctor so that they can help you manage it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continue reading for quick home remedies and period pain relief tips along with information on how to potentially reduce period cramps during your next period.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Using OTC (over-the-counter) medicines:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For menstruation discomfort and excessive menstrual flow, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) are used. For example, in India, commonly used substances are ibuprofen or Meftal Spas &#8211; the trade name for a tablet consisting of Dicyclomine (10mg) and Mefenamic Acid (250mg). These are available as prescription medicines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Heat application<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a warm bath or use a hot towel if you don&#8217;t have a hot water bottle or heating pad to relieve pre-period pain or cramps during periods.<strong> <\/strong>Heat therapy was shown to be as effective as NSAIDS in relieving menstruation pain in a 2018 evaluation of studies. It may also result in fewer adverse effects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Using essential oils for massage<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 20-minute massage therapy can sometimes prove to be one of the most beneficial pain relievers for menstrual cramps. Massage treatment for menstruation involves pushing certain spots on your abdomen, side, and back while the therapist&#8217;s hands move around them. Aromatherapy massage with essential oils may have extra advantages as per some studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Orgasming<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While no clinical research has been conducted on the direct effect of orgasms on period cramps, science suggests that it may be beneficial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaginal orgasms affect your entire body, including your spinal cord, which triggers neurotransmitter release. A vaginal orgasm can cause the release of neurotransmitters like endorphins and oxytocin in your brain which can help to reduce pain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Avoid certain foods and add herbs to your diet<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoiding meals that promote bloating and water retention during menstruation is a good idea. The few of the worst culprits are foods rich in fat, carbonated drinks, alcohol, salty foods, caffeine and so on. Painful cramps and stress can be relieved by reducing or eliminating these foods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the evidence supporting home remedies for period pain is very mixed, there are many anecdotal reports of the same being helpful. So adding ginger, chamomile, white peony etc. have been reported by many, including traditional medicine practitioners to provide symptomatic relief as they contain anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic substances that can help relieve menstruation pain by reducing muscle spasms and swelling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>When to consult a gynaecologist<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if the above period pain remedies don\u2019t work for you, you should consult a physician. The following symptoms are your sign to visit the doctor:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>the pain prevents you from doing everyday tasks<\/li><li>the pain worsens or the bleeding becomes heavier over time&nbsp;<\/li><li>you&#8217;re over 25 and severe cramps are a new occurrence&nbsp;<\/li><li>over-the-counter medications don&#8217;t work<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A doctor&#8217;s diagnosis of the reason of your menstruation discomfort is the best approach to seek treatment in extreme circumstances.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"717\" class=\"wp-image-1892\" style=\"width: 500px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-5.png\" alt=\"reduce period pain- ask pinky promnise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-5.png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-5-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-5-1024x680.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-5-768x510.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[15],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1886"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1886"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1886"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

It is normal to get emotional during periods and it is also normal to get emotional before periods. This change in emotions is a part of something called as Premenstrual Syndrome or PMS. PMS technically happens a few days before your actual period starts. Due to change in hormone levels close to your periods, it takes place somewhere in the second half phase of your menstrual cycle. This phase is called the luteal phase. The luteal phase begins a day after your ovulation happens and ends on the day your period starts. Though there\u2019s no evidence as of yet that speaks about the actual cause behind PMS, imbalanced hormone levels are considered to be one of them. Most women experience PMS during their periods too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Mayo Clinic, research suggests that signs and symptoms of PMS could be emotional-behavioural and\/or physical. Mood swings, anxiety, depressed mood, appetite change\/food cravings, crying spells, trouble sleeping (insomnia), irritability, anger, etc. are potential emotional-behavioural symptoms of PMS. Whereas physical signs and symptoms of PMS include lower back pain, leg pain, abdominal bloating, diarrhea, constipation, headache, <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/periods\/how-to-reduce-breast-pain-before-periods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pain in breast<\/a>, acne, fatigue, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some women experience PMS so intensely that they find it difficult to pull off their daily routine work too. But that\u2019s not the case for everyone. Others may experience it at a mild level. However, usually, PMS is not a cause of stress because PMS eventually stops on its own 3-4 days after your periods start. The Mayo Clinic also goes on to say that 3 out of every 4 menstruating women have experienced some form of premenstrual syndrome.\u00b9<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Common reasons for PMS include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Hormonal fluctuations associated with getting on one\u2019s period.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Shortages in Serotonin level &#8211; a neurotransmitter which is said to play a major role in feeling happy.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Sometimes, severe forms of PMS can be linked to underlying undiagnosed depression in someone. In that case, medical advice from your healthcare provider can help to figure out the actual reason.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some simple ways of reducing PMS is doing things which can create a happy feeling in your head like exercise, orgasms, sleeping well, eating foods rich in antioxidants, vitamin B6, magnesium and Vitamin-E.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>      <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"723\" class=\"wp-image-1479\" style=\"width: 500px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Is-it-normal-to-get-emotional-during-periods..png\" alt=\"emotional during period\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Is-it-normal-to-get-emotional-during-periods..png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Is-it-normal-to-get-emotional-during-periods.-300x201.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Is-it-normal-to-get-emotional-during-periods.-1024x686.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Is-it-normal-to-get-emotional-during-periods.-768x514.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[15],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1316"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1316"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1316"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

It&#8217;s a sign that your body is ready to begin reproduction. Puberty is the period of your life when your body goes through a lot of changes which typically start between the ages of 12 and 15 years. For example, on the exterior, you&#8217;ll notice hair starting to grow under your arms and around your pubic area, as well as the development of your breasts. On the inside, you begin to have periods as a result of the release of female hormones estrogen and progesterone.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most girls, periods start when she is about 12 years old, though it varies from person to person. Some girls may begin as early as 8 years while others may start as late as 15 years depending on family history, race, food, environment, and weight. Period start age is usually any number between 10 and 15.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What causes periods to occur?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes in hormone levels is the main cause behind the start of the period. The hormone estrogen rises throughout the first half of the menstrual cycle, thickening the uterine lining. If pregnancy happens, this lining will nurture a fertilised egg (embryo). An egg in one of the ovaries begins to mature as the lining thickens. The egg is released from the ovary (ovulation) on day 14 of an average 28-day cycle. The egg moves to the uterus through one of the fallopian tubes. Pregnancy is confirmed if an egg is fertilised by a sperm and attaches to the uterine wall. If the egg is not fertilised, it falls away, hormone levels decline, and the thicker uterine lining is shed through the vagina. This marks the beginning of a period.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What will your periods be like?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every woman&#8217;s period is unique. Periods can differ in length, frequency, and intensity. Some women experience extremely mild periods, while others experience quite heavy periods. Some might even experience irregular periods<strong> <\/strong>due to reasons like PCOS, early pregnancy, use of hormonal contraceptive pills, excessive exercise, stress, or because of excess weight loss or weight gain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people get a light first period with only a modest amount of blood. It could start out slowly, with spots or brown discharge before turning red.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Periods start suddenly for some, with bright red blood appearing right away. This is normal in either circumstance. The colour of period blood can range from brownish to dark reddish. Some people may also pass small blood clots.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to prepare for periods?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some menstrual products that you should keep handy:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sanitary pads &#8211;<\/strong> Sanitary pads are padded strips that come in a variety of sizes, with a sticky side that you stick to your underwear to keep them in place.

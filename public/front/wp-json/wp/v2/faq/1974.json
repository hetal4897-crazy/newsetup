This fluid escapes from the vagina every day to remove old cells and debris, keeping the vagina and reproductive system clean, hydrated and healthy. There are many vaginal discharge types<strong>,<\/strong> and each type of discharge has some indication. We will be discussing them further in this article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Top things to know about vaginal discharge and your cycle<\/strong>:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Vaginal discharge does not mean you have an infection.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Different phases of the menstrual cycle affect the type and volume of vaginal discharge.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Increased amounts of stretchy, clear, and wet discharge can be a sign of ovulation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some people look at their cervical fluid discharge to get clues about ovulation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colour, consistency, and amount of discharge<strong> <\/strong>can vary from one day to another depending on where a person is in their menstrual cycle. Additionally, it may differ from person to person. How the colour and texture of vaginal discharge varies with time in a woman&#8217;s cycle (for a 28-day cycle) is explained below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 1\u20135 &#8211;<\/strong> As the body sheds the uterine lining at the beginning of the menstrual cycle, discharge is typically red or bloody. This is the menstrual flow or period and may vary from person to person, in the number of days, amount per day, colour etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 6\u201314 &#8211;<\/strong> Vaginal discharge usually decreases after the period is over. As estrogen levels begin to rise, the cervix starts to produce more fluid. At first, discharge may be cloudy, thick and sticky. Then it may become wet and creamy, like a lotion. Discharge during this time can look whitish and cloudy, or even yellowish (especially if it\u2019s dry on your underwear). This may be first noticed around day nine or ten. People have different cycle lengths and ovulation can vary from cycle to cycle, even in people who feel their cycles are predictable.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Around Ovulation \u2013 <\/strong>The discharge is usually clear, wet, slippery and stretchy. There is a lot of cervical fluid secreted during the days right before ovulation. The vagina will likely start to feel much wetter. This is caused by estrogen peaking one to two days before ovulation. Discharge may look like raw egg whites that can be stretched for inches between your thumb and finger.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 14\u201325 &#8211;<\/strong> As soon as ovulation is over, vaginal discharge decreases. The mucus may return to cloudy, whitish, yellowish and potentially sticky or tacky post-ovulation. Progesterone hormone is higher during this phase and this decreases the release of fluid from the cervix.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 25-28 &#8211; <\/strong>The mucus may be thicker, cloudy or gluey. Some people experience dry days before menstruation or period.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the different vaginal discharge <strong>types<\/strong>?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few different<strong> <\/strong>types of vaginal discharge to watch out for. The colour and consistency of the discharge usually determine how it is categorised. There may be some additional symptoms such as itching or burning to differentiate. Some of the discharges are perfectly normal. Others might be a sign of a deeper problem that needs to be addressed. The following describes the various discharge colours and their causes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Red<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colour red can range from bright to dark rusty red. The most common cause of red discharge is period bleeding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An average woman&#8217;s menstrual cycle lasts 28 days, with the usual range being 21 to 35 days. A period is usually 3\u20135 days long. If one is experiencing bleeding\/red discharge on days other than the period, they should consult a doctor. Intermenstrual bleeding has numerous reasons such as hormonal issues, etc. and can also indicate a severe problem such as sexually transmitted infections, cervical cancer and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should see a doctor if you are experiencing red discharge\/vaginal bleeding after menopause and haven&#8217;t had a period for a year. It can be a symptom of endometrial cancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>White<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s common to have some white discharge, especially at the start or end of your menstrual period. The colour white can range from cream to light yellow. White discharge is most likely an indication of good lubrication if there are no other symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you experience thick white discharge (cottage cheese-like consistency) accompanied by itching or burning, or if it has a strong odour, it is not normal and should be treated. This type of discharge could indicate a yeast infection, which can cause irritation and itching.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clear and watery<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s totally normal to have a clear, watery vaginal discharge. It can happen at any point during the month, especially around ovulation. It may be seen especially after heavy exertion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pink<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discharge can be pinkish-white or mild or dark pink. Spotting before menstruation is the most prevalent cause of the pink discharge. During or after ovulation, some people have spotting, which can lead to pink discharge. Sexual intercourse can result in a pink discharge if there is minor irritation or small tears in the vaginal area. It could also be an indication of implantation bleeding if there was unprotected sexual intercourse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clear and Stretchy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re probably ovulating if your discharge is clear but stretchy and mucus-like rather than watery. This type of discharge is a normal discharge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Yellow or Green<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The presence of a faint yellow colour in the discharge may not indicate a concern. This is especially true if the colour shift occurs solely after a change in diet or supplementation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not normal to have a yellow discharge or green discharge, especially if it&#8217;s thick, chunky, or has an unpleasant odour. This type of discharge could indicate trichomoniasis infection. It is usually transmitted through sexual intercourse. If you experience this type of discharge, consult a doctor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Seek medical help if you experience &#8211; <\/strong>Fever, itching, burning, pain or discomfort, pain in the abdomen, spotting after sex regularly, a strong odour, yellow or green discharge, increased or burning urination, or any symptom that is not usual, as previously stated. The doctor will conduct a pelvic examination. They might also need to take a sample of the discharge for examination.<sup>1 2&nbsp;<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Some commonly asked questions:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the most common vaginal discharge?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaginal discharge that is white or off-white has a clear texture, and does not smell bad is the most common vaginal discharge. It is normal to experience this kind of vaginal discharge for women. This indicates that the vagina is doing a good job, and keeping itself healthy. The thickness and amount of vaginal discharge can change throughout your menstrual cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does vaginal discharge look like?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaginal discharge may look like anything ranging from watery and sticky to creamy, thick, and milky in texture. The colour of vaginal discharge can be milky white, off-white, or clear. The cause of this vaginal discharge is the hormones in your body. This fluid discharge from the vagina helps to remove old cells and debris and keeps the vagina and reproductive system clean, hydrated and healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What kind of discharge is not good?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An unusual vaginal discharge is something that does not look and feel normal. It varies in colour, texture, and smell and can even cause itchiness. Dark yellow, brown, green, greenish-yellow, thick cottage cheese-like white discharge is not good and can indicate an infection or an underlying problem.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why am I having so much wet discharge?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Normal and healthy vaginas produce watery discharge. During your reproductive years, it is normal for you to experience 1 to 4 millilitres (approximately 1\/2 teaspoon) of discharge every day. When your estrogen levels start to rise and closer to ovulation, during pregnancy, or on birth control pills, you can notice increased discharge.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does a thick white creamy discharge mean?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is perfectly normal to experience thick, white, creamy discharge throughout your menstrual cycle. If the discharge is odourless or has a little sour odour, is not yellowish-green or brown in colour, is normal in volume and consistency, and does not cause itching, there is nothing to worry about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discharge may be thinner on the days before ovulation (when an egg is released). At the time of ovulation, this discharge might become quite mucus-like and stretchy. This is when you will know that you are ovulating. People who ovulate often view this as a natural indicator of fertility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get pregnant, this mucus-like white discharge may be a sign that you should engage in sexual intercourse. This type of discharge is healthy if it does not have a strong odour or any additional symptoms.<sup>5<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does an yeast infection look like?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A yeast infection, also known as candidiasis, can arise anywhere on the body. The appearance of the infection depends on its location. It can appear like white patches in the mouth, skin peeling or crusting, or alterations in vaginal discharge.<sup>6<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does yeast infection discharge look like?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a yeast infection, your vulva&#8217;s appearance and the type of discharge that emerges from your vagina may vary. You can experience itching and burning in your vulval region, the skin area right outside your vaginal opening. It may appear red, swollen or inflamed. Peeing or having sex might make the burning and itching feel worse.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your vaginal discharge may be thick, clumpy and cottage cheese-like, but the odour is usually normal. Visit a doctor in order to understand your symptoms better and get the appropriate treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most vaginal yeast infections are treated with oral and local antifungal medicines. These medicines for vaginal discharge and itching should be prescribed by a doctor and are usually most effective in the form of a vaginal pessary or ointment for local application. Therefore, it is best to visit a doctor who can diagnose you properly and advise the correct medications.<sup>7<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1079\" height=\"710\" class=\"wp-image-1976\" style=\"width: 480px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/What-are-the-different-types-of-vaginal-discharge.png\" alt=\"vaginal discharge types- ask pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/What-are-the-different-types-of-vaginal-discharge.png 1079w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/What-are-the-different-types-of-vaginal-discharge-300x197.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/What-are-the-different-types-of-vaginal-discharge-1024x674.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/What-are-the-different-types-of-vaginal-discharge-768x505.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[13],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1974"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1974"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1974"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

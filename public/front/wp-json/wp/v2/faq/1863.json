Well,  there is no single medicine which can cure PCOS, there are many ways to manage the symptoms of PCOS. Neglecting to manage or take conscious care of PCOS can affect your health in many ways in the long run. If left untreated, PCOS can increase the risk of triggering health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, infertility, cardiovascular diseases, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your doctor will prescribe you a treatment for PCOS based on the symptoms you are experiencing.<sup>1<\/sup> Following are some options that can help you manage PCOS and its symptoms:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Weight management<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is observed that 60% of women with PCOS are either obese or overweight.<sup>1 <\/sup>Reducing some amount of body weight if your are overwieght can help improve PCOS and reduce its effects. Therefore, losing approx 5% of body weight can significantly help avoid the risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, blood pressure and chances of infertility. Losing weight can also help to reduce the production of androgen and insulin. This in turn would improve the regulation of ovulation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>Lifestyle changes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have insulin resistance or a high BMI along with PCOS, chances are that your doctor has suggested diet changes. There are certain foods which are low in&nbsp; glycemic index which are recommended for PCOS. Eating healthy meals will also help to avoid any risk of developing diabetes due to insulin resistance. Consider including fruits like various berries. Vegetables like tomatoes, kale, spinach, pumpkin sweet potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, red and green bell peppers and arugula. Lean protein sources like chicken, fatty fishes that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids (salmon and sardine) and tofu. Add more foods that\u2019s high in fibre. Furthermore, avoiding refined\/high carbohydrates and low fat food items can help to keep the insulin resistance in check. Red meats and processed foods like white breads, sugar dishes and desserts, etc are among the list of highly processed foods that can cause inflammation.<sup>3&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Maintain hormonal balance&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not wishing to get pregnant any time sooner then your doctor may prescribe you birth control pills. The hormones in birth control pills help to reduce the production of androgen. Androgen is a male hormone that is released in excess in women with PCOS. Reduction in androgen production can help reduce symptoms of PCOS like hirsutism that causes excess hair growth on face, chin, and male pattern baldness.<sup>4 <\/sup>Abnormal\/heavy bleeding, acne and excess hair growth can all be taken care of by combined oral birth control pills. The combined oral contraceptives pills can also benefit to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. <sup>5<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Exercises<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercising for a reason or without a reason will always reward you with lots of health benefits. Hence, working out to manage PCOS can be very beneficial for both- overweight women as well as the ones who ain\u2019t overweight. Having only a diet routine won\u2019t give you as much desired results as you think if you don\u2019t complement it with your workout routine. Stress is another reason that affects the period cycle. Exercising will not only help you to reduce excess weight gain, but can also significantly uplift your mood and reduce stress. Some exercises are yoga, pilates, brisk walking, jogging, swimming, gyming, etc are some workout options that may help to manage PCOS. <sup>6<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"708\" class=\"wp-image-1864\" style=\"width: 450px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/How-to-treat-PCOS.png\" alt=\"How to treat PCOS- Ask Pinky Promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/How-to-treat-PCOS.png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/How-to-treat-PCOS-300x197.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/How-to-treat-PCOS-1024x671.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/How-to-treat-PCOS-768x503.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[62],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1863"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1863"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1863"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

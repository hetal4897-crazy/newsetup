Weight gain can lead to PCOS and often, if one has PCOS,&nbsp;losing weight is tougher. This is because in order to lose weight, you need to maintain a certain calorie deficit and a certain diet and exercise regime. But thanks to a phenomenon called insulin resistance, which is linked to fat and PCOS, losing fat becomes harder.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Insulin is a compound secreted by your body and it is essential for good metabolism. Insulin helps to break down all the sugars we digest, into energy that your body requires to function. Impairment of insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance results when the cells of your organs such as muscles, fat, and liver don&#8217;t respond to insulin- a hormone released by the pancreas). Insulin resistance can either be temporary or chronic and can sometimes be treated.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having insulin resistance is common with those who have PCOS &#8211; irrespective of one\u2019s body weight! 70%-95% of obese patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and 30%-75% of patients who are of normal body weight have insulin resistance. Insulin levels are not only a symptom of PCOS- they are a major cause as well.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to insulin-related hormonal imbalances, high insulin levels lead to increased testosterone production in the ovaries. This in turn affects the follicle development and obstructs ovulation too. Weight gain can also be caused by insulin resistance, which makes PCOS symptoms worse because not having healthy fats triggers the body to produce more insulin.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per an article by Cleveland Clinic<sup>1<\/sup>, the larger factor that contributes to obesity is insulin resistance. In fact, when the level of glucose in the bloodstream increases, it causes type 2 diabetes to develop.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOS may contribute to weight gain in women. Moreover, having excess weight can lead to experiencing more symptoms related to PCOS. According to studies, more than half of the women with PCOS are overweight!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some tips that may help you reduce the impact of PCOS:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Always keep a weight check:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing 5% to 10% of your body weight through diet and exercise can help you prevent high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes symptoms, and possibly improve your fertility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>Control insulin level:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to helping to control diabetes, metformin can be beneficial in reducing symptoms of PCOS because it reduces insulin sensitivity. But remember to consume this only if prescribed by your doctor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Maintain hormonal balance:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help maintain hormonal balance and regulate the menstrual cycle for those women who do not want to conceive, oral contraceptives are a very good option. In addition to reducing cancer risk, maintaining hormone balance improves acne and skin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it is not yet proven that PCOS is a direct cause of weight gain, losing excess weight is always helpful right? There is yet no particular <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/polycystic-ovaries\/how-to-treat-pcos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">treatment for PCOS<\/a>, it can only be managed!

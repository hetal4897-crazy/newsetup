Read on to know more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several lifestyle and dietary modifications can help to make changes to one\u2019s fertility. Some of them include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Nutritional and dietary changes<\/strong>:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consume foods rich in folic acid and\/or ask your doctor about folic acid supplements. Broccoli, brussel sprouts, leafy greens, etc. contain a lot of folic acid. Folic acid helps the body in the production of new cells and red blood cells! During pregnancy, folic acid prevents several birth defects of the brain, spine and spinal cord.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eating healthy fats every day is important for <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/fertility\/which-foods-that-increase-fertility-in-females\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">boosting fertility<\/a> and overall health. Fats help to control inflammation, they aid a better hormonal balance, and also support our immune system. In fact, many nutrients which are needed for getting pregnant, are all fat soluble!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, make sure you have enough iron in your diet as it too helps make sure there is enough blood available for you and your baby! Low levels of iron before pregnancy may result in issues with ovulation and therefore cause issues with pregnancy.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Quit alcohol and smoking<\/strong>:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cut down on alcohol if you want to get pregnant. <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/fertility\/does-drinking-affect-fertility-in-females\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alcohol affects ovulation<\/a> and makes it difficult to conceive.<sup>3<\/sup> Worse than alcohol is definitely smoking. Smoking can increase the risk of miscarriage, and also the risk of low birth-weight babies and babies with developmental defects. If you are a smoker and decide to quit smoking, studies show a good return in fertility levels.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Maintain a healthy weight and exercise routine<\/strong>:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A healthy BMI is anywhere between 18.5-24.9. Anything above this can have an impact on your ability to conceive. Excess fat can affect the menstrual cycle and ovulation by creating hormonal imbalances.<sup>5<\/sup> A healthy exercise routine is a good thing to have if you are trying to get pregnant! However, at the same time, it&#8217;s also important to avoid over exercising when you are trying to get pregnant, as over exercise can cause you to not ovulate! <sup>6<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">         <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"730\" height=\"1068\" class=\"wp-image-1409\" style=\"width: 250px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Images-for-website-FAQs-natural-ways.png\" alt=\"natural ways to increase fertility- Ask Pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Images-for-website-FAQs-natural-ways.png 730w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Images-for-website-FAQs-natural-ways-205x300.png 205w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Images-for-website-FAQs-natural-ways-700x1024.png 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[11],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1307"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1307"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1307"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

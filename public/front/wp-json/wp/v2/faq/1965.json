Secondly, symptoms of STD start depending on which sexually transmitted disease you have.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Symptoms and signs of STD might arise in a matter of days or weeks, but they can also take months or even years to appear. While unprotected sex always increases the chance of getting an STD, condoms are particularly effective at reducing its transmission when used appropriately. However, no method is foolproof, and symptoms of an STD aren&#8217;t always visible. It is possible to have an STD and not be aware of it. In case you think you might have one depending on the STD warning signs, visit a sexual health clinic or your doctor for STI testing<strong><sup> <\/sup><\/strong>and treatment.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>When do STD\/STI symptoms appear?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The duration between being exposed to an STI and experiencing symptoms varies depending on the disease. The most common STIs and their incubation periods are listed below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">Chlamydia<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The disease is caused by a bacterial infection of the genital tract. Chlamydia infections can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages since they usually manifest few or no symptoms. It takes between one and three weeks after you&#8217;ve been exposed to chlamydia for symptoms to appear. They are usually mild and short-lived.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are possible signs and symptoms:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Painful pee<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Pain in the lower abdomen<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Bleeding between periods in women<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Discharge from the vagina in women<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Discharge from penis in men<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Testicular pain in men<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Women experience pain during sexual intercourse<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">Gonorrhea<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bacteria in the case of gonorrhea can grow in your mouth, throat, eyes, and anus. The earliest signs of gonorrhea usually develop within 10 days of exposure. Some people, on the other hand, maybe infected for months before showing signs or symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are some of the signs and symptoms of gonorrhea:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Penis or vaginal discharge that is thick, cloudy, or bloody<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; You may experience pain or a burning sensation while peeing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding in between periods&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Testicles that are painful and swollen<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Constipation that hurts<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Anal itchiness<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">Genital Herpes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Symptoms can occur after 4 to 7 days, but they may not start for months or years. Among the signs and symptoms are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Tiny, painful blisters surrounding the genitals<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Tingling or itching around the genitals<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Pain while urinating<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of individuals are unaware that they have genital herpes since there are no indications or symptoms, or the symptoms are so minor that they go undetected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">Trichomoniasis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trichomoniasis is a common STI caused by <em>trichomonas vaginalis<\/em>, a microscopic one-celled parasite. This bacteria is spread by sexual contact with someone who is already infected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organism enters the urinary tract in men, but it rarely causes symptoms. In women, trichomoniasis usually affects the vaginal area. Symptoms of trichomoniasis can emerge anywhere from five to twenty-eight days after exposure and range from minor discomfort to severe inflammation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are possible signs and symptoms:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Vaginal discharge can be clear, white, greenish, or yellowish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Discharge from penis in men&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Vaginal odour is really strong<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Itching or discomfort in the vaginal area<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Irritation or itching inside the penis<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Pain during sex<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Pain while peeing<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>HIV<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>After 2 to 6 weeks, the first symptoms may appear. They may include the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Flu-like symptoms, such as high fever, sore throat, headaches, and aching muscles or joints<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Red rash on the body&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone who is infected will experience these symptoms. Although, it lasts for about a week or two in the people who show these symptoms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the infection is still present in your body, you may not experience any more symptoms for many years after the first symptoms have subsided.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Syphilis<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Symptoms often develop after 2 to 3 weeks, however, they can appear sooner or later. They are as follows:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; A blotchy rash and flu-like symptoms that may appear a few weeks later&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; A small sore or ulcer on the genital area without pain<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Symptoms aren&#8217;t always visible, and they can come and go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Genital Warts<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Symptoms of genital warts can occur anywhere from three weeks to months or even years following contact with the virus that causes them. Among the signs and symptoms are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Swellings in your genital area that are small, flesh-colored, or grey<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; A cauliflower-like formation of several warts that are close together<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; The genital area is itching or uncomfortable<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Bleeding during sexual intercourse<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, genital warts frequently cause no symptoms. Warts on the genital area can be as little as 1 millimetre in diameter or grow into enormous clusters. Warts can also form in the mouth or throat of someone who has had oral sex with an infected person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Scabies<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never had scabies before, it can take up to 6 weeks for symptoms to show. If you&#8217;ve had scabies before, it could take as little as four days. Among the signs and symptoms are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Genital itching (normally worse at night)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; spotty red rash <sup>2 3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>When to get tested?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is critical to diagnose and treat STDs as soon as possible in order to maintain your sexual health. While it&#8217;s crucial to avoid testing for STDs too early, knowing the incubation periods for the most prevalent illnesses will help you decide when to seek medical care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an STD, whether it&#8217;s bacterial, viral, or parasitic, getting treatment can help you avoid long-term health consequences.<sup>4<\/sup>    <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"716\" class=\"wp-image-1969\" style=\"width: 450px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/When-do-symptoms-of-STD-start.png\" alt=\"symptoms of std start- ask pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/When-do-symptoms-of-STD-start.png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/When-do-symptoms-of-STD-start-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/When-do-symptoms-of-STD-start-1024x679.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/When-do-symptoms-of-STD-start-768x509.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[14],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1965"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1965"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1965"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

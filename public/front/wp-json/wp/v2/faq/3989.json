It is also known as nursing. The decision to breastfeed should be your personal choice. There are many types of breastfeeding positions to look into. Many of us picture a happy baby nursing calmly while nestled in the crook of our arm when we think of breastfeeding or chestfeeding. While many of us have calm, fuss-free moments like these, most of us find that feeding the baby is anything but simple, at least at first.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Latching and positioning, in particular, might be tricky. It&#8217;s not always easy to figure out how to hold a baby just right to get them latching on well \u2014 and then sustain that latch and position throughout the nursing session. It may take some trial and error to figure out a breastfeeding position that works for you.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How many types of breastfeeding are there?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s great to have options when it comes to finding a comfortable and efficient breastfeeding position because no two parents or their newborns are alike. Fortunately, there are many breastfeeding positions for you to choose from. Let us discover more about these breastfeeding techniques and feeding methods for babies as we go further in this article.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the best method for breastfeeding?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Which breastfeeding is best for the baby? This is a common question that all new moms have! The best position for you is one in which both you and your baby are comfortable and relaxed, and you do not have to strain to keep the posture or continue nursing. Here are some of the common types of breastfeeding positions for your baby:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cradle position:<\/strong> Put your baby&#8217;s head in the crook of your elbow, with their entire body facing you. Place your baby&#8217;s belly against your body for the baby to feel fully supported. Your &#8220;free&#8221; arm can wrap around to support your baby&#8217;s head and neck, or you can reach through your baby&#8217;s legs to support the lower back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Football position:<\/strong> Line your baby&#8217;s back up with your forearm to hold your baby like a football, with your palm supporting the head and neck. This position is helpful with newborns and small babies. It&#8217;s also a good posture if you&#8217;re recovering after a cesarean birth and need to protect your belly from your baby&#8217;s pressure or weight.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Side-lying position:<\/strong> Sit up straight in a comfortable chair with armrests. Hold your baby in the crook of your arm that is opposite the breast you&#8217;ll be using to feed them. With your hand, you can support their head. Bring your baby across your body as your tummies are facing each other. You can use your other hand to cup your breast in a U-shaped hold. Bring your baby&#8217;s mouth to your breast and cradle them close to you without leaning forward.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cross-cradle hold:<\/strong> Place your baby&#8217;s head in the crook of your elbow, with their entire body facing you. Put your baby&#8217;s belly against your body so that they feel fully supported. Your &#8220;free&#8221; arm can wrap around to support your baby&#8217;s head and neck or reach through your baby&#8217;s legs to support the lower back.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Laid-back breastfeeding position:<\/strong> This position, also known as biological nurturing, is exactly what it sounds like. It boosts your and your baby&#8217;s natural breastfeeding instincts. On a couch or bed, lean back slightly. Make sure your head and shoulders are well-supported and rested. Hold your baby so that your entire fronts are touching. Allow your baby to sit in any position that is comfortable for them as long as their cheek is close to your breast. You can help your baby latch on if they need it.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to get a<\/strong><strong> good latch<\/strong><strong> during breastfeeding?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Position your baby facing you, so that the baby is comfortable and does not have to twist their neck to feed. Cup your breast with one hand and gently stroke your baby&#8217;s lower lip with your nipple. Your baby&#8217;s natural reflex will be to open the mouth wide. Bring your mouth closer around your nipple, trying to centre it in the mouth above the tongue, with your hand supporting your baby&#8217;s neck.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When both lips purse outward around your nipple, you&#8217;ll know your baby has &#8220;latched on&#8221; correctly. Your baby should be sucking on your entire nipple and most of the areola, the darker skin that surrounds your nipple. Breastfeeding must not be painful, even if you feel a tiny tingle or tugging. If your baby is not latched correctly on and nursing in a smooth, comfortable rhythm, nudge your pinky between your baby&#8217;s gums to break the suction, remove your nipple, and try again. A good &#8220;latching on&#8221; method can help prevent sore nipples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to know if your baby is hungry?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Crying is one of the most common ways your baby will try to let you know they&#8217;re hungry. Other signs that your baby is ready to be fed include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sticking out their tongue&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Licking their lips<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rooting is when they move their jaw, mouth, or head to look for your breast.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Putting their hand in their mouth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Opening their mouths.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fussiness<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sucking on something <sup>2<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the 5 5 5 rule for storing breast milk?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5:5:5 rule is a quick lifesaver for moms to store breast milk. Your lactation consultant will recommend you try and use the milk within five hours at room temperature, five days if in the refrigerator, and five months if in the freezer.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Signs and Techniques of Effective Breastfeeding<\/strong><strong> :<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep an eye out for signs of hunger in your baby, and breastfeed whenever your baby is hungry. It is known as &#8220;on-demand&#8221; feeding. You may need to breastfeed eight to twelve times every day during the first few weeks. Hungry babies move their hands toward their mouths, make sucking noises or mouth movements or reach your breast. Please do not wait for your child to cry. That&#8217;s a sign they&#8217;re very hungry.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Please be patient and breastfeed for as long as your baby wants to nurse each time. Don&#8217;t rush your baby through feedings. Typically, infants breastfeed for 10 to 20 minutes on each breast.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Being comfortable is very important. Try to relax during breastfeeding to increase the likelihood of your milk &#8220;let down&#8221; and flow. Before you begin to breastfeed, make yourself comfortable using pillows to support your arms, head, and neck, with a footrest to support your feet and legs.<sup>4<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/breastfeeding\/what-are-the-benefits-of-breastfeeding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">benefits of breastfeeding<\/a> for babies and learning different breastfeeding positions and techniques can be a game changer. However, sometimes attempting these techniques on your own isn&#8217;t enough, and having someone help you figure out how to try these positions, especially the first few times, can be really beneficial. Don&#8217;t be afraid to seek help from a lactation consultant or another experienced mom for the adequacy of breastfeeding. You&#8217;ll soon be the experienced one.<sup>5<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have more questions?

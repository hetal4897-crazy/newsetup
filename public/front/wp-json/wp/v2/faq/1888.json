First, it\u2019s a good idea to understand the causes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Causes of breast tenderness before periods&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sore breasts are a common symptom of the menstrual cycle that can be caused by a drop in estrogen and progesterone hormone levels just before menstruation. Hormone fluctuations causes changes in the breast tissues that can lead to premenstrual breast pain or tenderness in some women. Lymph node swelling can also occur as a result of these changes, which can further contribute to pain in the breast.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, hormones aren&#8217;t the only reason for sore breasts before periods. In many women breast pain before periods<strong> <\/strong>occurs only in one breast. Some physicians assume that if hormones were the main cause, both breasts would respond the same way. As a result, it&#8217;s likely that other bodily changes can induce breast pain around menstruation time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><strong>You can try to reduce breast pain during periods with these home remedies:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Applying warm or cold therapy with the help of heating pads or ice packs<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sleeping with a supportive bra<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reducing salt intake in order to reduce water retention<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimising caffeine consumption in your diet by avoiding coffee, soda, energy drinks, and tea<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding vitamin E or vitamin B-6 supplements to your diet<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Low impact exercises<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose food such as peanuts, brown rice, avocados, bananas, etc. which are rich in nutrients&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Medical treatments to reduce breast pain:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium, can effectively alleviate premenstrual breast pain. These medicines can also help with the cramping that comes with PMS. Sometimes, your doctor may prescribe these for you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/contraception\/how-to-take-birth-control-pills\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Birth control pills<\/a> can be used to reduce hormone fluctuations in case breast pain is related to periods.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Other hormonal medicines like Danazol, used to treat endometriosis and fibrotic breast disease symptoms may be prescribed if the pain is severe.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">Premenstrual breast soreness and swelling can often be adequately treated at home with home remedies and, if necessary, medications might be consumed. If lifestyle modifications and medication that has been prescribed to you do not help you feel better, consider talking to your doctor. Also consult your doctor before taking any of the above medications, since these can have side effects too. <sup>1 2 3<\/sup>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"704\" height=\"1070\" class=\"wp-image-1893\" style=\"width: 350px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-7.png\" alt=\"how to reduce breast pain before period- ask pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-7.png 704w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-7-197x300.png 197w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Images-for-website-FAQs-7-674x1024.png 674w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[15],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1888"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1888"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1888"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

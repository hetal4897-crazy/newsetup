At the same time, effective management of PCOS can result in a normal pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery as well. If you have PCOS and you find yourself reading this, do take heart.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOS is a syndrome marked by a few symptoms. Commonly, these symptoms are missed or irregular periods, large fluid filled sacs in the ovaries of eggs which haven\u2019t matured to their full size, and symptoms of elevated male hormone levels (called androgens) like acne, hair fall, male pattern balding etc. PCOS causes a woman&#8217;s body to produce more androgens than usual. Because men have substantially larger quantities of androgens than women, these hormones are commonly thought of as masculine hormones. Androgens have a role in the development of male sex organs as well as other male characteristics. The excess production of androgens leads to an imbalance in your reproductive hormones and can cause infertility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very often, if you have PCOS, you may have difficulty in ovulation. Ovulation issues, in turn, will affect the release of an egg and the chances of a sperm being able to fertilise that egg. This then <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/polycystic-ovaries\/how-do-polycystic-ovaries-affect-pregnancies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">affects pregnancy<\/a> outcomes. You may sometimes find yourself ovulating but due to other hormonal issues, other downstream requirements for a pregnancy like implantation etc. may not happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Infertility in women with PCOS, which is associated with a lack of ovulation, is a bit complex but can be managed. Because of an increase in testosterone production or because follicles on the ovaries do not mature, ovulation may not occur. Even if ovulation occurs, an imbalance in hormones may prevent the uterine lining from growing properly, preventing the mature egg from being implanted. Ovulation and menstruation can be irregular due to imbalanced hormones. Unpredictable menstrual cycles can also make pregnancy challenging.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Treatment for fertility in women with PCOS:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not looking to have a baby immediately but want to control and manage PCOS, your gynaecologist may choose natural lifestyle remedies like diet changes and exercise &#8211; especially if your symptoms are not severe and to manage insulin resistance. Other times, Your doctor may prescribe birth control pills that contain man-made estrogen and progestin hormones. By lowering testosterone production, these medications can help you manage your menstrual cycle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are ready to have a baby, your doctor may prescribe medications to help you ovulate (known as ovulation induction).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining a healthy body weight can aid in the regulation of menstruation and the control of blood glucose levels. A healthy, well-balanced diet and frequent exercise are therefore essential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to start tracking your periods if you haven&#8217;t already. Many calendars and fertility apps are available to assist you to determine when you&#8217;re most likely ovulating.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>When to call a doctor?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOS is a common cause of infertility that has been connected to a variety of other diseases. If you suspect you have PCOS, talk to your doctor about your symptoms and treatment of PCOS for fertility. Changes in your lifestyle and medical treatments can help you manage your symptoms, reduce your risk of developing additional health problems, and increase your chances of getting pregnant with PCOS.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you do not want to have children, having a <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/polycystic-ovaries\/how-can-i-check-if-i-have-pcos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PCOS diagnosis<\/a> early can help you avoid difficulties. Infertility can be caused by a variety of factors, but screening for PCOS can assist in personalised treatment of PCOS and increase the chances of pregnancy. If you do become pregnant, then also it is crucial to know if you have PCOS, as studies have linked PCOS to an increased risk of pregnancy problems.<sup>4<\/sup>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"708\" class=\"wp-image-1862\" style=\"width: 450px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Why-do-polycystic-ovaries-cause-infertility_.png\" alt=\"polycystic ovaries cause infertility- pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Why-do-polycystic-ovaries-cause-infertility_.png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Why-do-polycystic-ovaries-cause-infertility_-300x197.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Why-do-polycystic-ovaries-cause-infertility_-1024x671.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Why-do-polycystic-ovaries-cause-infertility_-768x503.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[62],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1861"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1861"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1861"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

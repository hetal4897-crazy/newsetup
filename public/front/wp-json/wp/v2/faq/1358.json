Based on the length of your menstrual cycle, if you have sex during your periods, the chances of getting pregnant may not be as low as you may imagine it to be!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On average, sperm can live or stay viable (alive and active) in the reproductive tract of a woman up to 5 days after unprotected sex.&nbsp; As a consequence, based on when a woman ovulates (i.e., when the egg is released) and how long her period is, there is a chance of pregnancy even if one has sex during their period. Simply put, if your cycle length is short, your fertile window may be earlier than you may think it to be. So even if you have sex on your periods, you may ovulate shortly after, and there may be a chance of the sperm staying alive in your system and coming into contact with the egg!<sup> 1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ovulation roughly happens in the middle of the menstrual cycle. For example, if you have a 28-day menstrual cycle and your periods last for seven days. This means that you may ovulate roughly between the 12th-14th day. If you have sex on the 6th day of your period, sperm could stay viable till the 11th day. However, if you have sex on the 7th day, it would be viable until the 12th day. Similarly, imagine your cycle was around 25 days long \u2013 that means you ovulate on the 11th day. If you had unprotected sex on the 7th day of your period, then you are at risk of getting pregnant.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is it okay to have sex on your period?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common question that all of us have but are afraid to ask is &#8211; Is it safe to have sex during periods? Remember, at no point is the pull-out method foolproof even if you may think you are not ovulating. That said, the risk of using the pull-out method during one\u2019s periods is certainly lower than at other points in one\u2019s menstrual cycle. In order to be fully aware of the risks that you may face while having unprotected sex during your periods, you need to understand three concepts &#8211; the menstrual cycle, ovulation and the duration of sperm viability.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Menstrual cycle &#8211;<\/strong> The <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/periods\/how-do-periods-work-the-menstrual-cycle-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">menstrual cycle<\/a> is the monthly set of changes that a woman&#8217;s body undergoes in preparation for pregnancy. The length of the menstrual cycle refers to the time from the first day of a woman&#8217;s period to the first day of her next period. The length of each menstrual cycle is usually around 28 days; this duration could be different for each woman. Regular cycles shorter or longer than this (21 to 40 days) are normal.&nbsp;In the first half of the menstrual cycle, the estrogen levels rise and cause the uterus lining to grow and thicken. In addition, a follicle-stimulating hormone causes the growth of follicles in your ovaries and this follicle, once developed, will turn into a fully matured egg. The ovary will then release this matured egg, also known as ovulation. While in the second half of the cycle, progesterone maintains the endometrial lining and helps the womb prepare for the implantation of the developing embryo. A woman is most fertile during ovulation and this is the time she could get pregnant.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ovulation &#8211;<\/strong> Ovulation refers to the release of an egg from your ovaries into the fallopian tube of the uterus. If the egg meets a sperm here, something called fertilisation happens. Fertilization is the process of formation of the embryo which grows into a baby inside the uterus. This means that if the fertilised egg (embryo) makes it to your uterus, you could get pregnant. Ovulation happens roughly towards the middle of your menstrual cycle. It is possible to still be bleeding very close to when you ovulate. For example, you could be on day 7 of your period and be bleeding, and ovulate on day 10.<sup>3<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sperm viability &#8211;<\/strong> Viability roughly means that the sperm is alive and capable of fertilising an egg. Theoretically, sperm can stay viable in the female reproductive tract for up to five days. If you have sex even a few days before ovulation, you might get pregnant because the sperm would remain alive and be capable of fertilizing the egg when it is released. Remember that it takes only one sperm to fertilise an egg.<sup>4 <\/sup>Therefore, even if you have had unprotected sex during your periods because sperm can stay viable for about five days, there are chances that you can get pregnant if you ovulate in these five days. You should track your cycles to get a better sense of when you are fertile and ovulating.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, if you use birth control or are not worried about pregnancy, there are innumerable benefits of sex during periods. These are as follows:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Relief from period pain &#8211; <\/strong>Orgasms during sex can <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/periods\/how-to-reduce-period-pain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reduce period pain<\/a>. Uterine contractions occur to release its lining during your period, which results in menstrual cramps. While you are having an orgasm, the muscles in your uterus also tend to contract and release. This release can give you some relief from your period cramps. Sex also causes the release of endorphins, which are hormones that make you feel good. Additionally, having sex on your period helps to divert your mind from the pain and focus on pleasure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Shorter periods &#8211;<\/strong> Having sex on your period may shorten your menstrual cycle. The uterine contents can be pushed out more quickly during orgasm due to muscle contractions. This could result in shorter periods.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Increased sex drive &#8211;<\/strong> Hormonal changes can cause your libido to fluctuate throughout your menstrual cycle. Some women feel more turned on during their periods. While others may experience an increase in their sex drive during ovulation (about two weeks before their periods).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.<\/strong> <strong>Natural lubrication &#8211; <\/strong>Blood can act as a natural lubricant for sex during periods. Therefore, the need to use external lubrication during sex is reduced.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.<\/strong> <strong>It can relieve your headache &#8211; <\/strong>About 50% of women who suffer from migraines experience them during their periods. The majority of women who get menstrual migraines avoid sex during their attack. While women that have sex during their periods say that it helps them partially or fully reduce their headaches.<sup>5<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is period sex safe for guys\/penis owners?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Risk of infections including STIs\/STDs &#8211; <\/strong>Period blood is not by nature \u2018impure\u2019 or \u2018dirty\u2019. Therefore having sex during your partner\u2019s period will not cause any hygiene-related infections. However, period or no period, there is always a risk of sexually transmitted infections. Also, menstrual blood can transmit blood-borne viruses, including HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C if you have sex during period with an infected partner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, even when having sex during periods, use proper protection. For example, use a dental dam while having oral sex, make sure you and your partner get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and always use a condom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Risk of pregnancy &#8211; <\/strong>Even though it&#8217;s unusual, sex during periods can cause pregnancy. While the average menstrual cycle is of 28-days, there are some women who have a shorter menstrual cycle. For women with a shorter menstrual cycle, ovulation which otherwise takes place mid-way through the menstrual cycle can take place close to when the period ends. And since sperm can live for up to five days in a woman\u2019s body after having unprotected sex, there are chances for fertilisation to take place. In case the fertilised egg attaches itself to the wall of the uterus, implantation will take place and hence it is possible to become pregnant. So, in case you and your partner are not planning on pregnancy, it is important to use protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Risk of other infections &#8211; <\/strong>Period blood is sterile and cannot cause infections unless left in the air for a longer time. It is made up of blood as well as excess tissue from the uterine lining. Additionally, it might still have some of the egg&#8217;s components that were left in the uterus during ovulation when the egg was not fertilised. Also, period blood has no negative effects on the penis. Therefore, there is no need to be concerned even if the penis has some period blood on it.<strong><sup>6 7&nbsp;<\/sup><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Here are some of the tips that can help you in making sex during periods a more comfortable and less messy experience:<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Try to be open and transparent with your partner. You should let them know how you feel about having sex during your period and ask their opinions too. If either of you feel hesitant, discuss the reasons behind the discomfort.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you are wearing a tampon, remove it before you have sex.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spread a dark-coloured towel on the bed to catch any blood leaks, or you can try to have sex in the shower to avoid the mess entirely.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Keep a wet washcloth or wipes by the bed to clean up later.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wipe your intimate areas properly after having sex to reduce the risk of infections.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a condom to protect against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.<sup>8<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Can you have sex with a menstrual cup?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This depends on the kind of sex you want to have. It is not advised to have penetrative, vaginal sex (where you insert a penis into the vagina) while using a reusable menstrual cup. You can have oral and anal sex.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menstrual cups cannot pass through your cervix and can&#8217;t get lost inside you, but it is not advisable to use them during penetrative sex because:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A menstrual cup takes up space inside your vagina which leaves less space for a penis, sex toy or finger to enter the vagina.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The cup can cause discomfort during penetrative sex.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You may have pain if your cup is pushed up against your cervix.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sex could cause the cup&#8217;s suction to break, allowing it to leak.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your cup may get shifted behind your cervix, making it more difficult to be removed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you want to enjoy period sex and are not using any birth control, remember that menstrual cups are not designed to be used as a contraception. If you don&#8217;t want to become pregnant, use a reliable form of birth control when having period sex.<sup>9<\/sup> Don&#8217;t allow your periods to prevent you from enjoying your sex life. Sex can be just as enjoyable during those five or seven days as it is the rest of the month with some preparation. You might be surprised to know that having sex during your period is even more exciting! But it is also untrue that one can have unprotected <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/periods\/can-we-do-sex-during-periods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sex during periods<\/a> and not get pregnant! Using birth control like condoms, birth control pills etc., is always a good idea if you are not planning to get pregnant.<sup>10 11<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">  <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" class=\"wp-image-1400\" style=\"width: 250px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/5.png\" alt=\"sex during periods- ask pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/5.png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/5-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/5-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/5-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/5-768x768.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[15],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1358"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1358"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1358"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

It is not necessary to avoid sexual activity while you are on your periods. Sex while menstruation period can be a little messy but it is absolutely safe (if you use protection) and even helps to reduce menstrual cramps. However, do not forget to use birth control measures like condoms, contraceptives, etc. in order to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and also unwanted pregnancy. Sex during periods has a lot of benefits which are as follows: <sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1<\/strong>. <strong>Relief from period cramps:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Menstrual cramps may be relieved by orgasms. The contractions of your uterus is the cause behind menstrual cramps since the lining is being released. The muscles of your uterus contract when you experience an orgasm and then relax. As a result of this discharge, <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/periods\/how-to-reduce-period-pain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">period cramps<\/a> should be alleviated. Sex also causes the release of endorphins, which make you feel good. Furthermore, sexual activity diverts your mind away from the discomfort of your period.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.<\/strong> <strong>A greater desire for sex:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During your menstrual cycle, hormonal fluctuations impact your libido. Few days before you are about to get your periods, some women report an increase in sex desire, whereas others claim they feel more sexually inclined during their menstruation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.<\/strong> <strong>Helps you relieve your headache:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately half of all women experience migraine headaches during their periods. Although most women with menstrual migraines avoid having sex during their attacks, many of those who do, report that it helps to relieve their headaches partially or entirely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.<\/strong> <strong>Periods with a shorter time frame:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During period sex, it is likely that the length of your menstrual cycle reduces. This is because, when you experience an orgasm, muscle contractions force the uterine secretions out faster which leads to a shorter time frame of periods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Is there anything wrong with period sex?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it is okay to have sex while on your period, there are some risks to consider:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.<\/strong> <strong>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) threat:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sexual activity that is not protected by a condom or other form of contraception increases the risk of infection and the chances of developing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Some STDs, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are much more easily spread during unprotected sex while on your periods. STDs can even spread through oral sex! Using barrier methods of contraceptives such as condoms, dental dams, etc. can however help to reduce the risk of contracting any such infections. This entails erecting a barrier between you and your reproductive organs in order to avoid skin-to-skin contact and helps practice safe sex. Depending on the type of sex you&#8217;re having, contraceptives including male condoms, female condoms, and dental dams may be appropriate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Pregnancy concerns:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unprotected sex during periods can cause pregnancy, even during your period, along with the risk of STDs. Use birth control such as a condom, diaphragm, intrauterine device (IUD), or birth control pills to avoid unplanned pregnancy. Consult your doctor to discover the best method of birth control for you.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Sexual suggestions for women on their period<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some suggestions for making <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/periods\/can-having-protected-sex-delay-periods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">period sex<\/a> more comfortable and less messy:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tell your partner how you feel about having sex during your period and learn about their thoughts on the subject.&nbsp;<\/li><li>If either of you is reluctant, discuss the reasons for your reluctance.<\/li><li>If you&#8217;re using a tampon, take it out before you start messing around.<\/li><li>To catch any blood drips, place a dark-colored cloth on the bed.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Alternatively, avoid the mess entirely by having sex in the shower or bath.<\/li><li>To clean up afterward, keep a wet washcloth or wet wipes beside the bed.<\/li><li>If your typical sexual position makes you feel uneasy, try something new.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t allow your sex life to come to a standstill because of your menstruation.

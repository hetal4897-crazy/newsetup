As such, there is no difference between PCOS and PCOD. PCOD\u2019s full form is Polycystic Ovary Disease, and PCOS means Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. PCOD is an outdated term and PCOS is the most updated term for the same condition, but is one which encompasses the medical community\u2019s current advanced <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/polycystic-ovaries\/why-do-polycystic-ovaries-occur\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">understanding of polycystic ovaries<\/a>, its causes, and accompanying conditions. PCOS is a hormonal condition that affects women of reproductive age. As per Cleveland Clinic, up to 15% of women of reproductive age are affected by PCOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is the difference between <em>syndrome<\/em> and <em>disease<\/em>? A disease is when there is a good understanding of the causative process. However, something is considered a syndrome when there is a set of specific correlated symptoms whose underlying direct cause is not fully understood as they may be multiple and varied. For example, tuberculosis is a disease because there is a fair level of certainty that the bacteria called <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes <\/em>tuberculosis.<sup>1<\/sup> Whereas Metabolic Syndrome is a term used for a combination of diabetes, blood pressure and obesity, where the causes can be anything from genetics, lifestyle etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOS can happen at any time during a <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/periods\/how-do-periods-work-the-menstrual-cycle-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">women\u2019s menstruating<\/a> years. Some women might encounter PCOS in their early menstruating years right after puberty, while others might develop it later in life. Excessive weight gain can also be another reason behind or result for having missed\/skipped periods or having PCOS. There\u2019s a higher risk of you developing PCOS if it runs in your family. For example \u2013 if your mother or sister has\/had it, chances are, you might also develop it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the causes of PCOD\/PCOS?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common reason for PCOD\/PCOS is poor lifestyle choices \u2013 bad eating habits, lack of physical activity, irregular sleep cycle, unmanaged stress, nutrient deficiencies, genetic predisposition etc. The most common symptom is irregular, infrequent or absent periods. Having a 35 days gap or greater between periods or experiencing less than nine periods in a year could be a <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/polycystic-ovaries\/how-can-i-check-if-i-have-pcos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sign of PCOS\/PCOD<\/a> or an underlying issue.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, women suffering from <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/polycystic-ovaries\/what-is-pcos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PCOS<\/a> may experience hair loss, male pattern balding, acne, facial hair and so on. Some may get regular periods but suffer from the above symptoms related to an excess of male hormones. Others may not have these symptoms but may have irregular periods. Weight gain and an excess of fat tissues in one\u2019s body can also play a role in PCOS because there is a relationship between fat deposition and male hormones. Finally, stress levels, lack of sleep and a poor diet play an important role in the onset of PCOS\/PCOD.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which is more complicated &#8211; PCOD or PCOS?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no difference between PCOS and PCOD and often, doctors use them interchangeably. Therefore, please do not panic or worry that just because someone has used PCOS or PCOD it means something is more severe than the other. There is absolutely no difference between these names and their severity. In fact, the severity of your own PCOS\/PCOD is determined by your blood reports, whether or not you have polycystic ovaries on Sonography (and if so, how much), and some other symptoms you may face like increased BMI, central obesity, acne, hair fall, facial hair and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>PCOS\/<\/strong><strong>PCOD problem in future:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Women diagnosed with PCOD should regularly examine their health to prevent PCOD problem symptoms in the future. If left untreated, PCOD patients can develop type 2 diabetes, obesity, <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/polycystic-ovaries\/why-do-polycystic-ovaries-cause-infertility\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">infertility<\/a> and other mental health issues such as anxiety and depression due to hormonal imbalance.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCOD problems after marriage include infertility and <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/pregnancy\/what-are-the-most-common-pregnancy-complications\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pregnancy complications<\/a>. The reason is that sometimes women may have underlying PCOD with regular periods. In such situations, they may not know they have PCOD unless they get a proper diagnosis for the other PCOD symptoms. That is why PCOD is detected many times after marriage when women are trying to get pregnant. Early diagnosis and management of PCOD may help prevent the stress caused by such circumstances. PCOD can be managed and kept in check when detected timely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, untreated PCOS can lead to severe complications such as blood pressure, diabetes, endometrial cancer, and complications during pregnancy (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/abortion\/what-are-the-symptoms-of-miscarriage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">miscarriage<\/a> \/premature birth\/preeclampsia) along with predisposing the unborn child to diabetes as well as PCOS.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is PCOD or PCOS curable?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor lifestyle, obesity, stress, and hormonal imbalance are causes of PCOS. PCOS is actually quite common. Up to 15% of women of reproductive age have PCOS. So, in case you suspect you may have PCOS, or you already have been diagnosed for it, you can take heart in knowing that you aren\u2019t alone and that it is an easily manageable condition. Understanding the signs and symptoms helps in the diagnosis of PCOS. There is still not much clarity on what exactly causes these symptoms. PCOD\/PCOS can be effectively kept in check with weight loss, eating a healthy diet, avoiding junk and processed foods, regular exercise, good sleep habits and stress management along with some supplement medications.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How can I reduce PCOD naturally?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it is PCOS treatment for unmarried or for married, there are a lot of options available to manage it naturally. But you should always consult a doctor before deciding which option to choose for PCOD problem treatment. Some of the natural ways to treat PCOD are listed below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dietary changes &#8211; <\/strong>You may be able to control your symptoms by eating healthy food and avoiding particular items. With the help of a healthy diet, it may be possible to regulate your hormones and menstrual cycle. Consuming processed, highly preserved and high-carbohydrate foods can increase insulin resistance and inflammation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Probiotics &#8211; <\/strong>Probiotics are beneficial for more than simply digestion and gut health. They may have a significant impact on the management of PCOD. They can also control sex hormones like androgen and estrogen and minimise inflammation. Think about consuming probiotic beverages and foods like kombucha and kimchi.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight management &#8211; <\/strong>Maintaining a healthy weight can help minimise insulin resistance, regulate your menstruation, and lower your risk of PCOD-related disorders. If you are overweight, some research suggests that gradually losing weight using a low-calorie diet is a promising first-line treatment for PCOD.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exercises &#8211; <\/strong>Maintaining a healthy weight requires exercising. However, too much activity might disturb your hormones, so consult your doctor about a good balance. You can select anything starting from walking, yoga, Pilates, swimming or aerobics. High-intensity interval exercise and long-distance running may also help reduce PCOD symptoms. What kind of exercise would be the most beneficial for you? Discuss with your doctor to know.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stress reduction &#8211; <\/strong>Stress reduction can control cortisol levels. Various methods, like yoga, getting adequate sleep, and cutting back on caffeine, might help reduce stress. Walking outside and making time in your schedule for rest and self-care might also help you feel less stressed.<sup>5<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to cure PCOD problems permanently?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no permanent solution to PCOD problems. But the good news is that you can effectively manage it with the help of dietary changes, exercises, lifestyle changes, etc., as explained above. It is crucial to identify PCOD\/PCOS early on in order to manage the condition and symptoms.

A white, milky discharge from the vagina may be experienced by a woman. This is due to the thickening of the vaginal walls, which occurs early in pregnancy. The discharge is caused by the increased development of cells lining the vaginal canal.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it can be very confusing and highly misleading if someone assumes that <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/vaginal-discharge\/what-is-vaginal-discharge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vaginal discharge<\/a> a sign of pregnancy. It is therefore important to take a urine pregnancy test roughly a week or so after a missed period if you suspect you may be pregnant in order to be confident.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, excess vaginal discharge or a change in vaginal discharge can be a sign of vaginal infection or an STI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>C<\/strong><strong>ommon types and symptoms of vaginal infections<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the symptoms of vaginal infections are similar, making it difficult to distinguish between them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, each type of infection has its own set of symptoms:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Bacterial vaginosis (BV):<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A thin greyish-white, greenish, or yellow discharge is common in BV. The odour of this discharge might be fishy, and it is worse after penetrative vaginal sex. It&#8217;s possible that you won&#8217;t notice much scratching.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Yeast infections:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It causes itching, discomfort, and burning in the vaginal and vulva areas. Swelling in the labia, or the folds of skin on the outside of your vagina is another symptom of yeast infections. Any discharge will typically be white and lumpy, with a texture similar to cottage cheese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Trichomoniasis:<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This infection usually produces vaginal irritation as well as a fishy odour. You may notice swelling, irritation, and inflammation in your vagina and vulva, as well as a greenish-yellow, frothy discharge. Pain during vaginal sex, lower abdomen pain, and burning and pain while urination are also symptoms of trichomoniasis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Atrophic vaginitis:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t precisely an infection, but it can raise your risk of vaginal infections and urinary tract infections. You may experience symptoms that match those of other infections, such as vaginal itching, burning, dryness, and changes in discharge if you have atrophic vaginitis.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Why are there changes in your vaginal discharge during pregnancy?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A woman may notice a minor increase in vaginal discharge early in pregnancy. Because hormone (estrogen) levels rise during pregnancy, the body produces more discharge and increases blood flow to the uterus and vagina.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The increased discharge also protects the fetus by preventing external infections from spreading up the vagina and into the uterus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A woman&#8217;s discharge will increase as the pregnancy progresses till birth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>What does pregnancy discharge look like?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthy vaginal discharge during pregnancy is termed as Leukorrhea. It is similar to regular discharge since it is thin, transparent, or milky white, and smells just mildly or not at all. However, pregnancy might cause an increase in the volume of discharge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Contact your gynaecologist when:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early pregnancy might be detected by a change in the amount of vaginal discharge. If you see a change in your vaginal discharge, regardless of pregnancy worries, you should consult a doctor, who can help diagnose the problem and provide the required medication.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other changes in the colour or texture of vaginal discharge, on the other hand, are more likely to be caused by an infection and should be treated by a gynaecologist.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If changes in vaginal discharge are accompanied by pain or irritation, seek medical care.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">       <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"711\" class=\"wp-image-1979\" style=\"width: 500px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-vaginal-discharge-a-sign-of-pregnancy-1.png\" alt=\"Vaginal discharge a sign of pregnancy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-vaginal-discharge-a-sign-of-pregnancy-1.png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-vaginal-discharge-a-sign-of-pregnancy-1-300x198.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-vaginal-discharge-a-sign-of-pregnancy-1-1024x674.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-vaginal-discharge-a-sign-of-pregnancy-1-768x506.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[13],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1978"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1978"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1978"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

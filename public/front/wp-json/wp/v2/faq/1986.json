But some smells may be problematic and indicate an infection. Vaginal discharge smell<strong> <\/strong>is normally mild that is neither unpleasant nor disgusting, with colours ranging from transparent to milky. Vaginal discharge is a natural and healthy way for the vagina to clean itself. It&#8217;s the vagina&#8217;s way of letting you know it&#8217;s doing its job! The fluids and cells generated by the uterus, vagina, or cervix make up this vaginal discharge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An increase in the amount of discharge, as well as a change in the smell of vaginal discharge<strong>, <\/strong>colour, or texture, may indicate a problem. Other symptoms associated with a shift in discharge include discomfort, itching, or burning in or around your vaginal area. The combination of these factors can assist you to figure out what&#8217;s going on within your body.<sup>1<\/sup> A vaginal discharge is deemed abnormal if it contains the following characteristics:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; more than normal<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; thicker than usual<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; white and clumpy (like cottage cheese)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; like a pus<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; greyish, greenish, yellowish, or reddish in colour<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; vaginal discharge with foul smell or fishy smell<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; discharge accompanied by itching, burning, a rash, or pain<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As women, we learn what is healthy and good for our bodies. When it comes to our natural feminine odour and vaginal health, the same is true. Our noses can be the best detectives when it comes to determining whether everything is proper or if there is a problem. Using scented products to make your vagina smell nice and pleasant will only harm its pH level and the good bacteria that keeps it healthy. A healthy vaginal odour may be mild yet pleasant, but when bacteria are out of balance as a result of vaginal infections, our noses are likely to smell it immediately. In fact, any fishy or foul odour is abnormal and should be discussed with your doctor for appropriate<strong> <\/strong>medical advice.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at what vaginal discharge smell like in case of an infection, or STI, as well as the possible causes, symptoms, and what you can do if you have a foul-smelling discharge:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Bacterial Vaginosis:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most prevalent vaginal infection in women of reproductive age is bacterial vaginosis (BV). It is a type of vaginal irritation brought on by an excess of the normally occurring bacteria in the vagina, which disturbs the natural pH balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Females with BV may have abnormal vaginal discharge that is thin, off-white, grey, or greenish in colour. The discharge can have an unpleasant, fishy odour at times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Possible symptoms of BV include a burning sensation while peeing, vaginal itching or soreness, fishy smell that is strongest after sex or during the menstrual cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antibiotics are frequently prescribed by a doctor to treat BV.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Trichomoniasis:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trichomoniasis is a type of parasitic sexually transmitted infection. The parasite responsible is Trichomonas vaginalis (a single-celled microorganism).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Females with trichomoniasis may experience the following symptoms:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; thin, foul-smelling discharge which is clear, white, grey, yellowish, or greenish in colour<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; vaginal itching, burning, or pain<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; skin redness on and around the genitals<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; itchiness and pain when urinating<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; pain during sex <sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Gonorrhea:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a bacterial infection that is spread through sexual contact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of women who have gonorrhea have no symptoms, though they may notice increased vaginal discharge. Other symptoms that may appear include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; increased vaginal discharge<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; urination that is painful or burning&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; vaginal bleeding between menstrual cycle<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; abdominal or pelvic pain <sup>5<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Chlamydia:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another sexually transmitted bacterial infection is chlamydia. The majority of chlamydia infections are asymptomatic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Symptoms include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; unusual vaginal discharge that has a different smell<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; pain when peeing or having sexual intercourse<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; itchiness or irritation in the genital region<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; stomach ache and fever<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; bleeding in between cycles<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; periods that are painful <sup>6<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Genital Herpes:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Genital Herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection. Most people who have it do not show any symptoms. If you do experience symptoms, they may include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; pain or itching in and around the genital area<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; burning sensation while peeing as the urine touches the herpes sores<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; trouble in peeing as the sores and swelling are blocking the urethra<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; small blisters around the genitals, anus, or mouth that could burst and turn into painful sores<sup> 7<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your body is only known to you. Talk to your doctor if you have a vaginal discharge that doesn&#8217;t seem usual to you (with or without other symptoms). In most cases, the cause is an infection. Antibiotics, antifungal, and antiviral medications may be prescribed depending on the type. If the infection is transferred sexually, the person&#8217;s sexual partners may require treatment as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1074\" height=\"710\" class=\"wp-image-1987\" style=\"width: 450px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Does-vaginal-discharge-smell.png\" alt=\"vaginal discharge smell- ask pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Does-vaginal-discharge-smell.png 1074w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Does-vaginal-discharge-smell-300x198.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Does-vaginal-discharge-smell-1024x677.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Does-vaginal-discharge-smell-768x508.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1074px) 100vw, 1074px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[13],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1986"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1986"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1986"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

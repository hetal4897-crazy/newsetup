The only distinction is that it is to be taken only after sex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emergency contraception can be effective, but it is not a replacement for regular birth control. Regular birth control is more effective, less expensive, and has fewer side effects. Emergency contraception, as the name implies, is only for emergencies and should not be used on a regular basis.<sup>1<\/sup>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the types of emergency contraception methods?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. The emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) or the &#8220;morning-after&#8221; pill:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The morning-after pill is a sort of emergency contraception (birth control) intended to prevent pregnancy in women who have had unprotected sex or whose birth control method has failed. The ECP should only be used as a backup and not as the primary method of birth control because long term or frequent exposure to the amount of levonorgestrel present in the pill, can cause irregular or absent periods. For the emergency contraceptive pill to be effective, you must take the pill within 3 days after unprotected sex &#8211; the sooner you take it, the better. Some common <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/emergency-contraception\/what-are-the-side-effects-of-emergency-contraceptive-pills\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">side effects of emergency contraceptive pills<\/a> include headaches, stomach pains, nausea and discomfort with periods. If you feel sick or vomit the pill within 3 hours, contact your doctor. You&#8217;ll need to take another dose or get an IUD.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. The Copper-T Intrauterine Device (IUD):&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An Copper-T IUD is a tiny T-shaped device made of copper that is placed in your uterus to prevent pregnancy. For the Copper-T to be effective as a form of emergency contraception, it must be placed within 5 days after unprotected sex. The IUD is more effective than the pill at preventing pregnancy. Just around 1% of women who use the IUD become pregnant. If you&#8217;re using the IUD as an emergency contraceptive, you can keep it in and utilise it as your usual method. When the IUD is placed, you may experience some discomfort, although medications can help. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/emergency-contraception\/will-emergency-contraception-affect-periods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">periods can be longer, shorter, heavier, or lighter<\/a> if you use the IUD as a regular method of contraception.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who can use emergency contraception?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent unplanned pregnancy, any woman or girl of reproductive age may require emergency contraception. The use of emergency contraception has no absolute medical and age restrictions. The same eligibility conditions that apply to normal use of a copper IUD apply to emergency use of a copper IUD.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>When do you need emergency contraception?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve had unprotected sexual intercourse \u2014 either because you didn&#8217;t use birth control, skipped a birth control pill, were sexually abused, or your method of birth control failed \u2014 morning-after pills can help you avoid pregnancy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morning-after pills do not prevent an already implanted pregnancy. They typically function by suppressing or postponing ovulation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note that the abortion pill is not the same as the morning-after pill. This medication ends a pregnancy that has already begun to develop after the fertilised egg has bonded to the uterine wall.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does emergency contraception work?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Oral emergency contraception works by delaying ovulation. It is a hormone-based drug containing levonorgestrel and it works by temporarily preventing the release of an egg, stopping fertilisation, or preventing a fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The copper in the IUD functions by preventing a fertilised egg from implanting in the uterus even if you get it inserted after sex.<sup>5<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Points to bear in mind:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Follow the directions of the morning-after pill pack or as advised by your gynaecologist.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you vomit within two hours of taking the pill, consult your doctor about taking another dose.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You will not be protected from developing STDs such as HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) if you take emergency contraceptive pills. Therefore, don&#8217;t forget to use condoms when having sex! <sup>6<\/sup>   <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1075\" height=\"708\" class=\"wp-image-2443\" style=\"width: 450px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/What-is-emergency-contraception_.png\" alt=\"what is emergency contraception- pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/What-is-emergency-contraception_.png 1075w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/What-is-emergency-contraception_-300x198.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/What-is-emergency-contraception_-1024x674.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/What-is-emergency-contraception_-768x506.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1075px) 100vw, 1075px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[10],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/2115"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2115"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=2115"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

Go on reading to find the answer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During their menstrual cycle, most women experience a variety of distinct forms of discharge. Each day, you may create a teaspoon of thick or thin, odourless mucus, which can range in colour from white to clear to brown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colour of vaginal discharge varies during the menstrual cycle, but it is usually white right before and after a period. The colour and texture of healthy discharge might vary. If the white discharge is accompanied by a foul odour, itching, or burning, an infection may be prevalent. It&#8217;s possible that this is a sexually transmitted infection (STI).<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does white discharge before periods indicate?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/vaginal-discharge\/how-does-white-discharge-stop-in-women\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">White discharge<\/a>, also known as leukorrhea in medical terms, is common in the second half of the menstrual cycle. It&#8217;s loaded with fluid and cells shed from your vaginal area, and it can even appear yellow at times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A woman&#8217;s luteal phase is the last part of her menstrual cycle. It occurs when progesterone levels reach their highest point. The discharge is transparent, stretchy, or watery when the female sex hormone (estrogen) is the dominating hormone. On the other side, progesterone causes mucus to become cloudy or white. Some women monitor their discharge to see if they&#8217;re pregnant. This is known as a fertility awareness method or a natural family planning strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thin and stretchy mucus is considered fertile because it occurs around the time when an egg may be released. Cervical mucus that is a thick white discharge is deemed infertile. That makes sense because this sort of mucus is most common between ovulation and the start of your period when you&#8217;re no longer fertile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any discharge you have keeps your vaginal tissues healthy and moisturised, regardless of their colour or texture. It is considered normal if the discharge isn&#8217;t accompanied by symptoms like pain, itching, or redness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mucus may seem yellow in the days leading up to your menstruation. Brown discharge is also possible on the days either before your periods or after. The brownish discharge represents old blood leaving your body.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An early pregnancy sign may be spotting blood or brown discharge around the time of your expected period. If your period is late and you&#8217;re seeing spotting, a home pregnancy test is an excellent idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>When to contact your doctor?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before your menstruation, white discharge may be entirely normal. However, up to three out of every four women will suffer from yeast infections at some point in their lives. If you suspect a yeast infection, there are some home remedies you can try that may help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your symptoms don&#8217;t go away after a week or so of home treatment \u2014 or if you have any other concerns \u2014 schedule an appointment with your doctor. You should also consult a doctor if you&#8217;ve never had or been treated for a yeast infection previously. They can examine your symptoms and assist you in developing an effective treatment plan.<sup>2<\/sup> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also take up a self-assessment for issues with vaginal discharge on the Pinky Promise App chatbot which is gynaecologist verified and is absolutely free!     <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1079\" height=\"712\" class=\"wp-image-1973\" style=\"width: 480px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-white-discharge-a-sign-of-a-period-coming.png\" alt=\"Is white discharge a sign of a period coming- Pinky Promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-white-discharge-a-sign-of-a-period-coming.png 1079w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-white-discharge-a-sign-of-a-period-coming-300x198.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-white-discharge-a-sign-of-a-period-coming-1024x676.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Is-white-discharge-a-sign-of-a-period-coming-768x507.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[13],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1972"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1972"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1972"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

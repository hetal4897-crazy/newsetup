The vagina and the cervix produce fluid that carries away dead cells and bacteria. This helps to keep the vaginal health normal and avoid any type of vaginal infections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaginal discharge is common and usually harmless and it is in fact a very normal part of being a vulva owner. Depending on where you are in your monthly cycle, the amount, odour, and colour can all change. When you&#8217;re ovulating, breastfeeding, or sexually stimulated, you&#8217;ll have greater discharge. When you&#8217;re pregnant or have neglected your personal hygiene, it may <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/vaginal-discharge\/does-vaginal-discharge-smell\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/vaginal-discharge\/does-vaginal-discharge-smell\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">smell<\/a> differently. You may also experience more vaginal discharge during pregnancy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are no longer ovulating and your estrogen levels are shifting as you age and enter menopause, your body may generate less or no vaginal discharge. As a result, women in perimenopause, menopause, or postmenopause may have vaginal dryness.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of these <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/vaginal-discharge\/why-do-women-experience-vaginal-discharge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vaginal secretions<\/a> are alarming. But if the colour, smell, or consistency is out of the ordinary, especially if you&#8217;re also experiencing vaginal itching or burning, you may have an infection or some other problem.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is vaginal discharge normal?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Vaginal discharge is common in women, however not all discharge is healthy. Each woman has a varied amount of discharge. Some women experience occasional discharge. Others have discharge on a daily basis. Your &#8220;normal&#8221; discharge may fluctuate over a period of time.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normal vaginal discharge keeps vaginal tissues healthy, provides lubrication, and protects against infection and discomfort. The amount, colour, and quality of normal vaginal discharge vary depending on the stage of your reproductive (menstrual) period, ranging from whitish and sticky to clear and watery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abnormal vaginal discharge, such as a fluid with a strange odour or colour, or discharge accompanied by itching or pain, may indicate a problem.<sup>4<\/sup> Abnormal vaginal discharge can however be treated with antibiotics. As an example, yeast infections are usually treated with creams or gels containing antifungal medications. Antibiotic tablets or lotions are used to treat bacterial vaginosis.<sup>5&nbsp;<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What can a change in vaginal discharge indicate?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A variety of infections can cause vaginal discharge to alter or become unpleasant.

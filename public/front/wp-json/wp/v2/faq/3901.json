A Complete\u00a0Guide!"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Vaginal discharge is completely normal most of the time. The amount of vaginal discharge, its odour and colour (which can range from clear to a milky white-ish) can vary based on the time in your menstrual cycle. For instance, while you are ovulating, breastfeeding, or sexually aroused, there will be more discharge. It may smell different if you&#8217;re pregnant if you neglect your personal hygiene. None of these changes is cause for concern. So, what is considered abnormal vaginal discharge? If the colour, smell, or consistency seem unusual, especially if you also have vaginal itching or burning, you may have an infection or another condition.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is considered abnormal vaginal discharge?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Normal and abnormal vaginal discharge<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A normal vaginal discharge has to be clear or white.

The normal vaginal discharge, known as leukorrhea, will begin to change as soon as one to two weeks after conception, even before you have missed your period.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This discharge usually becomes more noticeable as your pregnancy progresses, and at its heaviest near the end. This happens because of the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy. You should use an unscented panty liner and avoid tampons throughout pregnancy. You may also notice streaks of thick mucus with blood in your discharge in the last weeks of pregnancy (known as &#8220;show&#8221;). It is a common early symptom of labour and should not be a cause for alarm. If you have an abnormal vaginal discharge during pregnancy, please consult a doctor.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does unhealthy discharge mean?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have different types of abnormal vaginal discharge, and vaginal discharge can be a sign of an infection if it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If it causes itching and swelling.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If it has a bad or fishy-smelling odour.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If it is green, yellow or grey in colour<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If it looks like cottage cheese or pus.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If it causes pelvic pain or pain when you pee.<sup>5<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are experiencing any of the above and are worried about your vaginal discharge, come to the Pinky Promise app and consult a friendly gynaecologist at just Rs. 59!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the types of discharge?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The colour of your vaginal discharge can vary, and vaginal discharge can range in colour from healthy to concerning. Possible colours include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Yellow, green or grey colour &#8211; <\/strong>A yellow, grey, or green discharge may indicate that you have a bacterial or sexually transmitted infection (STI) like trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis.

Your vaginal discharge can be wet or gummy (like egg whites) during ovulation. But, if your vaginal discharge is white but thicker than usual or causes itching, you may have yeast infections, and a cloudy white discharge can be a sign of gonorrhea.<sup>6<\/sup><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>When should I be concerned about an abnormal discharge?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As discussed above, if you experience an unusual discharge, it is advisable for you to go to a doctor.

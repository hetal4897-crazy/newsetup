It\u2019s the vagina\u2019s way of showing that it is doing its job! Therefore, when women experience vaginal discharge, it is safe to say that their vagina is maintaining good health. This vaginal discharge is composed of fluids and cells secreted\/released by the uterus, vagina or cervix. Vaginal secretions serve the function of cleaning and lubricating the vagina. It also protects the vagina from any sorts of irritation and vaginal infections, and helps to preserve the health of vaginal tissues. Hence, that\u2019s how vaginal discharge helps your vagina to cleanse itself and maintain an infection free environment there! <sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each type of vaginal discharge indicates a different meaning. The colour, consistency, odour and texture of a normal vaginal discharge may vary depending upon what reproductive phase you are in. Vaginal discharge before periods may look a bit whitish. While the same may look clear and sticky like mucus when you are likely to be ovulating. You may notice increased <a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/vaginal-discharge\/is-vaginal-discharge-a-sign-of-pregnancy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vaginal discharge during pregnancy<\/a>. This is completely normal and healthy as well, as it protects the womb by keeping infections at bay. According to the NHS of UK, women who are pregnant, sexually active and on hormonal birth control can experience more vaginal discharge. Also, if you are engaging in high levels of physical activity or if you are sexually aroused, you may notice an increase in vaginal discharge. Also, your vaginal discharge may change over the course of life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not all vaginal discharge is normal. Sometimes, vaginal discharge can be a sign of an infection or an issue which requires medical treatment. The colour, texture and odour of vaginal discharge can help distinguish between what is normal and what is not. While white, off white, liquidy, clear discharge is usually normal- beware of itching, burning and other colours! If your vaginal discharge is accompanied by pain and vaginal itching it could be symptoms of Vaginitis. Yellow or green coloured discharge could indicate a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI). If you find that your discharge is white or yellowish but clumpy, like cottage cheese, with fishy odour and itching, it may be a yeast infection. Finally, abnormal vaginal discharge could also be a sign of&nbsp;Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). PID is caused when bacteria (usually from an untreated STI), travels up from a woman&#8217;s vagina and cervix, to the pelvic\/reproductive organs. The right kinds of antibiotics and antifungals can easily help you to tackle the above issues. Finally, if your discharge is bloody and you aren\u2019t close to your periods, and you are also experiencing bad odour, you may want to get screened for cervical cancer.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" class=\"wp-image-1419\" style=\"width: 300px;\" src=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Why-do-women-experience-vaginal-discharge_.png\" alt=\"women experience vaginal discharge- ask pinky promise\" srcset=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Why-do-women-experience-vaginal-discharge_.png 1080w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Why-do-women-experience-vaginal-discharge_-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Why-do-women-experience-vaginal-discharge_-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Why-do-women-experience-vaginal-discharge_-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Why-do-women-experience-vaginal-discharge_-768x768.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":[],"topics":[13],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq\/1315"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/faq"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/faq"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1315"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"topics","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/topics?post=1315"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

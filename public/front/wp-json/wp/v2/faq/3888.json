This discharge is produced by your uterus, cervix, and vagina, which consists mainly of cells and bacteria. It helps to clean and lubricate your vagina and helps fight against bad bacteria and infections. Vaginal discharge is a natural and normal process in your body and vaginal discharge is caused due to normal or abnormal reasons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, changes in discharge can indicate an infection or disease. Some women produce more vaginal secretions than others, while others notice very little discharge. Changes in the colour, texture, odour, or amount of your usual vaginal discharge could indicate a problem. You can use medications to treat most causes of abnormal vaginal discharge.<sup>1<\/sup>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the vaginal discharge causes?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vaginal discharge is a healthy bodily function caused by natural changes in estrogen levels. The amount of vaginal liquid can increase due to ovulation, sexual arousal, birth control pills and pregnancy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes in the bacterial balance of the vagina can have an adverse impact on the colour, smell, and texture of vaginal fluid discharge in females. This is because vaginal infections are more likely to occur as the number of harmful bacteria increases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the infections that could be the reasons for vaginal discharge:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bacterial Vaginosis &#8211;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bacterial vaginosis is a common bacterial infection causing an increased vaginal discharge with a strong, foul, and occasionally fishy odour. The vaginal discharge may appear grey, thin, and watery as well. In some cases, this infection does not have any symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bacterial vaginosis is not transmitted from one person to another through sexual contact, but you are more likely to develop it if you are sexually active or have recently gotten a new sexual partner. This infection can also increase your chances of developing a sexually transmitted infection (STI).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trichomoniasis &#8211;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trichomoniasis is another type of parasitic infection. It is usually spread from one person to another through sexual contact, you can also get it through the sharing of towels or bathing suits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to half of those affected with trichomoniasis will experience no symptoms. Those who do will frequently notice a yellow, green, or frothy discharge with a foul odour. Common symptoms include pain, inflammation, and itching around the vagina and when urinating or having sex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Yeast Infection &#8211;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A yeast infection happens when yeast growth in the vagina increases. It creates a thick, white discharge that looks like cottage cheese, and this discharge is usually odourless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other symptoms include burning, itching, irritation around the vagina, and also causes pain during sex or urination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following factors can increase your risk of yeast infections:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stress<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Diabetes<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using birth control pills<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pregnancy<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Antibiotics (if used for more than ten days)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gonorrhea and Chlamydia &#8211;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gonorrhea and Chlamydia are STIs that can cause an abnormal discharge by infecting the cervix. It is usually yellow, greenish, or cloudy in appearance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also experience other symptoms like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Pain while urinating<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stomach pain<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bleeding after penetrative sex<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bleeding between periods<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But some people may also have zero symptoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Genital Herpes &#8211;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This STI can cause thick vaginal discharge with a strong odour, especially after having sex. Sores and blisters around the genitals can appear, as can bleeding between periods and a burning sensation when urinating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it is more common to have no or minor symptoms. But if you do develop symptoms, you may have repeated outbreaks throughout your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) &#8211;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heavy, foul-smelling discharge, stomach pain after sex or while menstruating, and urinating may be symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This occurs when bacteria enter the vagina and travel to other reproductive organs, and it can be caused by untreated STIs such as chlamydia or gonorrhea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Human Papillomavirus (HPV) or Cervical Cancer &#8211;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The human papillomavirus infection is spread through sexual intercourse and can lead to cervical cancer. Even though there may be no symptoms, this type of cancer can cause:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bloody, brown or watery discharge having an unpleasant odour<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bleeding occuring between periods or after sex<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pain while urinating or an increased urge to pee<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In rare instances, brown or bloody discharge can also be an indication of endometrial cancer, fibroids, or other growths.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the five types of discharge?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a href=\"https:\/\/askpinkypromise.com\/faq\/vaginal-discharge\/what-are-the-different-vaginal-discharge-types\/\"> different types of vaginal discharge<\/a> and the colour of your vaginal discharge may indicate a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Yellow, green or grey colour &#8211; <\/strong>A yellow, grey, or green discharge may indicate that you have a bacterial or sexually transmitted infection (STI).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brown or red colour &#8211; <\/strong>A brown or red discharge is generally associated with irregular periods or pregnancy (implantation bleeding).
